## Flying to Beijing

If you are flying to Beijing from abroad, the chances are that you are landing in the Beijing Capital International Airport. The Beijing Capital International Airport has three terminal buildings (T1, T2, and T3). Please follow the signs to find the places for baggage claiming, currency exchanging, local bus and taxi taking.

## Transportation between airport and hotel 

Taking a taxi is the most convenient transportation option between the airport and the hotel, which usually costs around 110 RMB, i.e., $16.5 U.S. dollars. **But let&apos;s remind you here, taxis do not accept credit card payment.** All of the taxis in Beijing are metered taxis, so the prices are relatively fair and inexpensive. The travel distance from the airport to the conference hotel is about 34 kilometers, which typically takes about one hour by car.


**It would be convenient if you can print out the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/files/local_info/Getting_here_Adresses.pdf" target="_blank">Chinese characters of the hotel names and addresses</a> and show them to the taxi driver.**

## Local bus from the airport to hotel

You can follow the sign to find the local bus ticket booths in Beijing Capital International Airport. The local buses from the airport to hotel run from 6 a.m. to 4 a.m. on the next day, which run about every 30 minutes to 60 minutes. The local bus ticket booths are located in front of Exit No.7 in the Arrival Hall of Terminal 3 Building, Exit No.11 in the Arrival Hall of Terminal 2. For the tickets purchase, cash payment is the best way, credit card and bank card are not accepted. The fares are divided into three categories: 20 yuan, i.e., $3, 25 yuan i.e., $3.7 and 30 yuan i.e., $4.5. The specific fares of each station on each line are announced at the airport local bus booth. To get to the conference hotel, you can take Line 4 and get off at Zizhuqiao Station, then walk about 400 meters. One thing we should draw your special attention to is that the **Google Map doesn&apos;t work in mainland China, you can try Apple Map app.**


**The attached <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/files/local_info/Getting_here_Line4.pdf" target="_blank">Chinese character</a>  means you want to go to Line 4, Zizhuqiao Station. It would be convenient if you can print it out and show it to the conductor.**
