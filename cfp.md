The ACM SIGCOMM 2019 conference seeks papers making significant research contributions to the field of data communication networks and networked systems. The conference takes a broad view of networking research, which includes new ideas relating (but not limited) to :

* Different network types, layers, and devices:
  * Wide-area, data-center, home, enterprise
  * Sensors and Internet of Things
  * Network access in remote or under-served areas
  * Wireless and mobility
  * Routers, middleboxes, network functions, end-host network stacks
  * Link and transport layers
  * Applications, including distributed systems and social networks
  * Virtual networks and SDNs
  * Future network architectures: clean slate and evolution

* Aspects and properties of networks:
  * Correctness and performance
  * Security and privacy
  * Fault tolerance
  * Energy consumption
  * Usability
  * Emergent properties
  * Management
  * Resource allocation, provisioning and planning
  * Economics
  * Topology

* Different evaluation methods:
  * Theory
  * Experiments
  * Measurement
  * Deployment and experience

We expect submissions to be daring and emphasize novelty and creativity. We recognize that more novel concepts can be harder to fully develop and evaluate, and the review process will take this into account. We encourage authors to discuss the limitations of their ideas in addition to the benefits.

Unlike some previous years, SIGCOMM 2019 will not have a separate experience track. However, we do encourage the submission of experience papers, particularly from industry, that provide detailed technical insight into real-world deployments of novel networking technologies and systems.

In addition to the main conference, SIGCOMM 2019 will have a series of co-located workshops, tutorials, poster and demo sessions, a travel grant program, and conference best paper and SIGCOMM awards.

# Submissions
Submissions should report novel results that are supported by experimentation, deployment, simulation, or analysis. Submissions must be in 2-column, 10-point format and can be up to 12 pages long, with as many additional pages as necessary for references and optional appendices.

<em>New in 2019:</em> Submissions and final papers may include appendices (following references, also not counting against the 12 pages). Appendices will not be considered in reviews, so we caution authors to ensure that the core paper is complete and self-contained. (For example, if the appendix provides details of a proof or experiment, the body should summarize the key result.) For accepted papers, the shepherd will review appendices and must approve their need. Appendices may also include non-traditional material, such as videos, datasets, code, etc.

Detailed submission instructions can be found [here](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2019/submission.html).

# Ethical Concerns
<em>New in 2019:</em> All papers must include, in the main body of the paper, a statement about ethical issues. This could be simply the sentence “This work does not raise any ethical issues.” If the work involves human subjects or any potentially sensitive data (e.g., user traffic or social network information, evaluation of censorship, etc), the paper should clearly discuss these issues, perhaps in a separate subsection.

Papers must follow basic precepts of ethical research and subscribe to community norms. These include: respect for privacy, secure storage of sensitive data, voluntary and informed consent if users are placed at risk, avoiding deceptive practices when not essential, beneficence (maximizing the benefits to an individual or to society while minimizing potential harms to an individual), and risk mitigation. Authors may want to consult the [Menlo Report](http://www.caida.org/publications/papers/2012/menlo_report_actual_formatted/) for further information on ethical principles, and they may find the [Allman/Paxson paper in IMC 2007](http://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2007/papers/imc80.pdf) helpful for a perspective on ethical data sharing.

Many organizations have an ethics review process (sometimes called an Institutional Research Board, IRB). In some cases, research work may clearly have no human subjects, and formal institutional review may not be required. (However, a sentence in the paper stating this evaluation is still required.) In many cases, IRB involvement is appropriate. IRB approval of research is an important factor (and should be mentioned), but the TPC will still evaluate ethical soundness of the work, just as they evaluate technical soundness.

If there are questions about the ethics process, please contact the program committee co-chairs. The PC takes a broad view of what constitutes an ethical concern, and the TPC chairs may reach out to authors during the review process if questions arise.

# Research Reproducibility
ACM is promoting research reproducibility by encouraging papers to document the artifacts needed for others to reproduce their work. ACM has details at [https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging.](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging) They will award accepted papers a “reproducibility badge” if the paper provides pointers to public code and other information as described at the above link. Authors who wish to participate in this process should document such information in an appendix to the paper. Information about reproducibility is not required at paper submission, but is required at camera ready. As an appendix, it will need to be provided to the shepherd with adequate time for review. While we encourage authors to participate, formal participation is not a factor in SIGCOMM reviewing.
