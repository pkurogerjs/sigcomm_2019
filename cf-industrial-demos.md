The 2019 SIGCOMM industrial demo session will continue the highly successful tradition of previous SIGCOMM industrial demo sessions since 2015. The session showcases demos from industry in the areas of networking and cloud, networked systems, as well as new forms of network intelligence and networked applications. The objective of this session is to bring together industry and academia around demos of innovative and cutting-edge technology and products.

## Why Present Industrial Demos at SIGCOMM?

SIGCOMM is the flagship annual conference of the ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication (SIGCOMM) on the applications, technologies, architectures, and protocols for computer communication. The conference is single-track and features a high-quality technical program with significant opportunities for technical and social interactions. SIGCOMM is the premier conference in its field and typically attracts over 600 attendees (scientists, engineers, educators, and students).

An industrial demo is an opportunity for companies to show industrial leadership and innovative thinking. Presenting cutting edge industrial technology will attract top academics to work on problems that are relevant to industry and help push forward the frontier of industrial knowledge. The industrial demo session is also a great recruiting opportunity. SIGCOMM attracts students from the most selective top-class universities around the world.

## What to Submit?

Please submit a small description of your demo (up to two pages) together with the names and affiliation of the demo presenters. Please also specify the Demo requirements, including space, power and network requirements, etc.  The Industrial Demo Chairs are responsible for the selection of industrial demo program in conjunction with SIGCOMM industrial liaison board. Demos coming at least partly from industry can be submitted also to the general SIGCOMM demo session. The industrial demo session puts more focus on products and upcoming technologies towards which an industry player is already committed (e.g., technology on roadmap), while research projects from industry that are more experimental are better suited for the general SIGCOMM Demo session. Feel free to contact the Industrial Demo Chairs (by clicking on the button below) or the regular demo chairs if you have any questions.

## What to Expect?

Accepted demos will be scheduled in a two-hour session at the conference, during which the demo will need to be manned. Demos can stay up during the entire day each day, so it is possible to show them to participants during breaks as well. Demos that utilize wireless networks must be prepared to arrange appropriate spectrum sharing with other such demos at the venue. Demos that require large amounts of Internet uplink capacity are unlikely to find that available at the venue.

On registration: One presenter of accepted industrial demos will be required to register for the conference at regular registration rate (or use complimentary registrations if they are becoming conference sponsors). The rest of the presenters could register as exhibitors and recruiters. For specific rates, please see the registration page. The technical people of the sponsoring companies who present industrial demos and also intend to attend the regular conference sessions will need to pay the regular registration fees (or utilize the complimentary registrations that come with the sponsorship package).
