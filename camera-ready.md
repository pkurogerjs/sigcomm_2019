The ACM SIGCOMM 2019 conference seeks papers making significant research contributions to the field of data communication networks and networked systems. The conference takes a broad view of networking research.  Please see the [Call For Papers](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2019/cfp.html) for a list of topics of particular relevance.
<!--The ACM SIGCOMM 2019 conference seeks papers describing significant research contributions to the field of data communication networks and networked systems. SIGCOMM&#39;19 takes a broad view of networking research. This includes new ideas relating to (but not limited to) mobile, wide-area, data-center, home, and enterprise networks using a variety of link technologies (wired, wireless, visual, and acoustic), as well as social networks and network architecture. It encompasses all aspects of networks and networked systems, including packet-processing hardware and software, virtualization, mobility, sensors, provisioning and resource management, performance, energy consumption, topology, robustness and security, measurement, diagnosis, verification, privacy, economics and evolution, interactions with applications, internet-of-things, novel applications of machine learning to networking, and usability of underlying networking technologies.-->


Paper submissions typically report novel results firmly substantiated by experimentation, simulation, or analysis. As an aid to the community, the SIGCOMM web site provides [useful advice](https://www.sigcomm.org/publish/hints-tips-and-guides/) to authors planning to submit to SIGCOMM conferences. 

Authors of conditionally accepted papers have been notified. They should work with their sheperds to address the reviewers' concerns. All papers will require explicit approval of the final version from the shepherd.

Authors should upload camera ready versions of their papers to HotCRP, both for shepherd review and for the final version.

Shepherds should indicate when a paper is complete by e-mail to the authors and TPC chairs.

## Paper Formatting
All submissions must obey the following formatting requirements. 

- Paper bodies (all content before references and appendices) must be no more than **<span style="color:red">twelve (12) single--spaced pages</span>**, including figures and tables, followed by as many pages as necessary for references and optional appendicies. Papers whose pre-reference content is longer than 12 pages will not be reviewed.
- Appendices may supplement the paper, but cannot be essential the
paper's central results. (For example, if the appendix provides details of a proof or experiment, the body should summarize the key result.)
- The paper body must include some statement about ethical considerations. This could be simply the sentence "This work does not raise any ethical issues", or for a paper involving human subjects, the discussion may be more detailed.
- Papers must be formatted for printing on Letter-sized (8.5” by 11”) paper. Paper text blocks must follow ACM guidelines: double-column, with each column 9.25” by 3.33”, 0.33” space between columns. Each column must use **9-point** font or larger, and contain no more than 55 lines of text. 
- It is your responsibility to ensure that your submission satisfies the above requirements. If you are using LaTeX, you may make use of [this template for ACM conference proceedings](https://github.com/scyue/ccp-sigcomm18). With the older versions of this template you *must add "10pt" to the documentclass command to meet the submission requirements. The current template sets 10pt by default. (Unlike the official template, it only includes example for conference proceedings.)*
- Please makes sure all fonts are embedded in the document. On Mac, Windows, and Linux, the 'pdffonts' (Poppler) and Adobe Reader tools can report this information. For more information, please see [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/614619/how-to-find-out-which-fonts-are-referenced-and-which-are-embedded-in-a-pdf-docum](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/614619/how-to-find-out-which-fonts-are-referenced-and-which-are-embedded-in-a-pdf-docum) .

You can visually inspect a page-by-page report of your paper format using the same tool as the submission system via a separate [online form](https://www.sysnet.ucsd.edu/sigops/banal/index.php).

After the submission deadline, we will use the same tool to check the conformance of papers. The format checking tool uses heuristics and can make mistakes. The publication chairs will manually inspect and possibly reject those papers with evident format violations. 

Please make sure that your submitted paper satisfies the following:
- You must provide an abstract, and it should be of no more than 200 words.
- You must *not* number the pages.
- You must submit papers in PDF (Portable Document Format) and ensure that they are compatible with Adobe Acrobat (English version). Other formats, including Postscript, will not be accepted. Avoid using non-standard fonts. The PC must be able to display and print your submission exactly as we receive it using only standard tools and printers, so we strongly suggest that you use only standard fonts that are embedded in the PDF file.
- You should ensure that the paper prints well on black-and-white printers, not color printers. Pay particular attention to figures and graphs in the paper to ensure that they are legible without color. Explicitly using grayscale colors will provide best control over how graphs and figures will print on black-and-white printers.
- You should ensure that labels and symbols used in graphs and figures are legible, including the font sizes of tick marks, axis labels, legends, etc.
- You should limit the file size to less than 15 MB. Contact the PC chairs if you have a file larger than 15 MB.
- Papers must provide proper indexing information in the final version according to the ACM Computing Classification System (CCS). More information about the ACM CCS is available on [ACM CCS website](https://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012).
- In its bottom-left corner, the first page of the final paper must include a copyright notice that the author receives after filling out the e-Rights form via the ACM rights-management tool on the HotCRP page of the paper. ACM will use its automated system to email this information to the authors. Please set your email spam settings to allow messages from “rightsreview@acm.org”. The copyright block includes the DOI specific to the paper, rights-management text that depends on the author’s choice of a license or copyright transfer, the official name, dates, and location of the event.

If you have any questions about the camera-ready process, feel free to contact SIGCOMM 2019 publication chairs [Keith Winstein and Xin Jin](mailto:publicationchairs19@sigcomm.org?subject=[SIGCOMM 2019]).

## Open access 
While the ACM rights-management tool offers the author to pay for open access to the published paper, SIGCOMM has already arranged free access to all SIGCOMM 2019 papers via non-expiring links to the ACM Digital Library (DL) on the SIGCOMM 2019 website. This is a special form of open access, which the ACM calls the OpenTOC service. Unless the author wants to provide the open access to the paper directly at the ACM DL rather than via the special SIGCOMM 2019 website link, we suggest that the author opts for not paying the open access fee in the ACM rights management tool.
