The N2Women dinner will be held on Thursday, August 22, from 6:30 pm to 10 pm in the conference hotel. The dinner is open to everyone who identifies with any minority, not just women. The N2Women dinner aims to foster the minority community within SIGCOMM, and make it easier for the under-represented attendees to fully participate in the conference. If you plan to attend, please submit a short registration at [https://forms.gle/r7YffMjrcYfJGhf2A](https://forms.gle/r7YffMjrcYfJGhf2A).
