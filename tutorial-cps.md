## Call For Participation

This tutorial will provide participants with challenges, solutions, and tools with hands-on exercises to modeling and analysis of network infrastructure in delay-constrained cyber-physical systems. Attendee will learn network calculus with cases studies of its applications in designing and analyzing wireless sensor networks and smart-grid substation networks.

Attendees will also learn details of DNC (NetworkCalculus.org), a comprehensive tool for network calculus analysis, and how to use it for analyzing the delay performance of tandem networks, tree networks, and feed-forward networks for CPS with hands-on labs.

## Background
Modern societies are witnessing the prevalence of a wide assortment of distributed cyber-physical systems (CPS) built upon network infrastructure for mission-critical applications, such as industrial process control systems and avionics. Such applications demand strict and deterministic delay performance of their CPS network infrastructure for system safety, stability and resilience. Thus there is an increasing interest in modeling and analysis of delay-constrained CPS.

Industrial process control systems and avionics had been developing networking solutions for decades and we can currently observe a convergence to a common standard. As an example take fieldbus technologies such as Profibus that had been developed for use in factory automation. With increasing demands on data rates and interoperability with existing off-the-shelf components, Ethernet-based solutions such as Profinet have started replacing the bus technologies. The same trend can be observed in the avionics sector where Airbus developed the Ethernet-based on-board communication system AFDX (Avionics Full-Duplex Ethernet) that has subsequently been adopted by its competitors Boeing and Bombardier. In addition to these industry-led developments for real-time-capable Ethernet, the IEEE has been working on official standards to address these use-cases of Ethernet. Its efforts first led to IEEE AVB (audio-video bridging) that defines traffic shaping, scheduling and path reservation for time-synchronized low latency streaming services. The continued development is led by the IEEE TSN (Time-Sensitive Networking) working group and TSN technologies are already discussed to be incorporated into Profinet and AFDX. Moreover, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has established a working group for Deterministic Networking (DetNet) that is closely collaborating with IEEE TSN in order to bring its concepts to the Internet.

Given that there is a technological convergence, the search for a common methodology for verification of real-time capabilities under any operation condition is complementary. During the development of AFDX, the Network Calculus was adopted and subsequently used for certification. Both the IEEE and the IETF have already discussed the applicability of Network Calculus to their respective problem spaces and standardization efforts. Recent development in network performance analyses especially network calculus and network modeling and measurements makes it possible for an organically integrated approach to modeling and analysis of delay-constrained networked cyber-physical systems. Researchers may be able to take advantage of the contents of this tutorial for their work when which may be utilized for analysis, identification and mitigation of delay performance bottlenecks of network infrastructure in cyber-physical systems.


## Audience Expectations and Prerequisites
Attendees are required to bring their own laptops with a Java 10 JDK and an editor for the hands-on lab. We recommend using the Eclipse Java IDE as dnc.networkcalculus.org provides documentation for configuring Eclipse.
