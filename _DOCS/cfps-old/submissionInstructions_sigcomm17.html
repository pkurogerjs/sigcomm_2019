Both new authors and veteran authors are urged to read through this page in its entirety. Our goal is to ensure that all authors have a consistent understanding of the submission process, and that everyone complies with the process fairly. If you have any questions about submitting papers to SIGCOMM 2016, or encounter problems with the paper submission site, contact the PC chairs well before the deadlines.</span></p><h2 class="c10"><a name="h.53fmu7dlj75v"></a><span class="c3">Experience Track </span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c2">SIGCOMM 2016 will carry forward the experience track first introduced in SIGCOMM 2015. The goal is to encourage submissions of papers on the design, analysis, and evaluation of techniques in commercial or otherwise widely used deployment. The PC will evaluate a submission to the experience track with the understanding that its contribution may lie predominantly in extending the community&rsquo;s knowledge of how known techniques fare in realistic settings, and particularly in settings that most in the community cannot duplicate, for reasons of scale or otherwise. At paper registration time, authors must explicitly indicate if a submission is to be considered for the experience track. Each submission will only be considered for one track - either the experience track or the main conference track, but not both - in accordance with the authors&rsquo; preference expressed at submission time.</span></p><h2 class="c10"><a name="h.cv8uoyrgqvz2"></a><span class="c3">Ethics Considerations</span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c2">Authors must as part of the submission process attest that their work complies with all applicable ethical standards of their home institution(s), including, but not limited to privacy policies and policies on experiments involving humans. The PC takes a broad view of what constitutes an ethical concern, and authors agree to be available at any time during the review process to rapidly respond to queries from the PC chairs regarding ethical standards.</span></p><h2 class="c10"><a name="h.r2rxqaivqe5r"></a><span class="c3">Paper Registration</span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c6"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sigcomm16.hotcrp.com&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNES3CYQzIsk5OQtAu_ghAZX-84m1A">Registration</a></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;only requires submission of paper metadata: paper title and abstract, author names, affiliations, contact email addresses, topics matching the subject matter of the paper, track (experience or main), and conflicts with PC members. The paper itself does not need to be submitted at the registration deadline. However, the paper title and abstract submitted during registration must be complete - not placeholders - and correctly characterize the paper that will be submitted. Authors can change the wording of their titles and abstracts for submission, but their essence should not fundamentally change. The PC will use the information provided during registration as a basis for making review assignments.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">Both authors and PC members provide PC conflict information. The PC will review paper conflicts to ensure the integrity of the reviewing process, adding conflicts where necessary. Broadly, we define conflict of interest with a PC member using the following principles:</span></p><ol class="c7 lst-kix_vgtb0vdr9wyz-0 start" start="1"><li class="c8 c11"><span class="c2">You are currently employed at the same institution, have been previously employed at the same institution within the last 12 months, or are going to begin employment at the same institution.</span></li><li class="c8 c11"><span class="c2">You have a professional partnership as follows:</span></li></ol><ul class="c7 lst-kix_vgtb0vdr9wyz-1 start"><li class="c8 c13"><span class="c2">Past or present association as thesis advisor or advisee.</span></li><li class="c8 c13"><span class="c2">Collaboration on a project, publication, or grant proposal within the past 2 years (i.e., 2014 or later).</span></li></ul><p class="c8"><span class="c2">If there is no basis for PC conflicts provided by authors, those conflicts will be removed. In particular, do not improperly identify PC members as a conflict in an attempt to avoid having an individual review your paper.</span></p><h2 class="c10"><a name="h.dej77zifar6h"></a><span class="c3">Paper Novelty</span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c2">Under no circumstances should authors submit previously published work, submit the same work simultaneously to multiple venues, or submit papers that plagiarize the work of other authors. Like other conferences and journals, SIGCOMM prohibits these practices and may take action against authors who have engaged in them. In some cases, the program committee may share information about submitted papers with other conference chairs and journal editors to ensure the integrity of papers under consideration. If the PC discovers a violation of these principles, sanctions may include, but are not limited to, contacting the institutions of the authors and publicizing the details of the case.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">SIGCOMM will review extended versions of previously-published short preliminary papers (such as workshop papers) in accordance with published </span><span class="c6"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.sigcomm.org/about/policies/frequently-asked-questions-faq/&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNEeaazrMjflApSzj8eHOZyhKu8uKg">SIGCOMM policy</a></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and the </span><span class="c6"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNGDGymwPLDgSA1wPY7i5kexNCuM3g">ACM Plagiarism Policy</a></span><span class="c2">. To preserve author anonymity, authors MUST cite this related prior work, while making a good-faith effort not to reveal common authorship. For example, such a submission should not explicitly point out that specific text has been adopted from the author&rsquo;s own prior work.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement requests will not be considered for publication, nor ever disclosed.</span></p><h2 class="c10"><a name="h.230dlus3wc0h"></a><span class="c3">Paper Anonymity</span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c2">All submitted papers will be judged based on their quality and relevance through double-blind reviewing, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers. As an author, you are required to make a good-faith effort to preserve the anonymity of your submission, while at the same time allowing the reader to fully grasp the context of related past work, including your own. Common sense and careful writing will go a long way towards preserving anonymity. Minimally, please take the following steps when preparing your submission:</span></p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_g48v949ynmll-0 start"><li class="c4"><span class="c2">Remove the names and affiliations of authors from the title page.</span></li><li class="c4"><span class="c2">Remove acknowledgment of identifying names and funding sources.</span></li><li class="c4"><span class="c2">Use care in naming your files.

Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work by another author.</span></li></ul><h2 class="c10"><a name="h.5o629dmjepvy"></a><span class="c3">Paper Formatting</span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c2">All submissions must obey the following formatting requirements.

The format checking tool uses heuristics and can make mistakes. The PC chairs will manually inspect and possibly reject those papers with evident format violations. However, no paper will be rejected due to format violations without first being checked by hand.</span></p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_c9gq5aqrmvdv-0 start"><li class="c4"><span class="c2">Submit papers of no more than </span><span class="c9 c12">twelve (12) single-spaced pages</span><span class="c2">, including figures, tables, any appendices, etc.followed by as many pages as necessary for references.

All accepted papers may be shepherded by members of the PC. Authors of accepted papers should plan to interact with their shepherds immediately after notification, and to budget sufficient time between acceptance notification and the camera-ready deadline to coordinate with their shepherd. It is a requirement that the paper be considered acceptable to the assigned shepherd so that the updates to the paper reflect the issues raised by the PC (conflicts will be mediated by the PC chairs) before the paper is considered &quot;accepted&quot; to appear in the conference proceedings. In addition, the publisher of the SIGCOMM proceedings will review all accepted papers submitted for the camera-ready deadline. Authors should also budget sufficient time immediately after the camera-ready deadline to be available and responsive to any editing changes requested by the publisher after submitting their camera-ready paper.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">After acceptance, substantive changes to paper titles require approval by the PC chairs. Only in exceptional circumstances should authors change their author list, and only with the approval of the PC chairs.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">Authors of accepted papers will also need to sign an ACM copyright release form. Electronic copies of the camera-ready papers will be published on the conference Web site before the conference, unless authors specifically request otherwise. All rejected papers will be treated as permanently confidential.</span></p><p class="c5"><span></span></p></body></html>
