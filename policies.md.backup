<!-- - [Stop Harassment](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment) -->

Discrimination and harassment are not to be tolerated within our community, and we are making a step forward to prevent and address any forms of unacceptable behavior during SIGCOMM 2019.

All SIGCOMM events and communications (emails, online social network groups, etc) must abide to [ACM policy against discrimination and harassment](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment). If a violation of this policy occurs, ACM urges reporting the incident to the event chairs or the ACM President, CEO, or COO. SIGCOMM recognizes that reporting to the conference chairs or an upper level ACM administrator can be intimidating, especially in the face of an already traumatic experience. 

<!--Following the steps of SIGARCH, the SIGCOMM EC is considering the implementation of a new subcommittee, called SIGCOMM CARES â€“ SIGCOMM Committee to Aid REporting on discrimination and haraSsment policy violations.-->
