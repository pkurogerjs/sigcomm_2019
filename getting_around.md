<div>
<p>The Forbidden City, historically and artistically one of the most comprehensive Chinese museums, was established on the foundation of the palace that was the ritual center of two dynasties, the Ming and the Qing, and their collections of treasures. Designated by the State Council as one of China&apos;s foremost-protected monuments in 1961, the Forbidden City was also made a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987.</p>

Situated at the heart of Beijing, the Palace Museum is approached through Tiananmen Gate. Immediately to the north of the Forbidden City is Prospect Hill (also called Coal Hill), while on the east and west are Wangfujing and Zhongnanhai neighborhoods. Twenty-four emperors lived and ruled from this palace during this 500-year span.
