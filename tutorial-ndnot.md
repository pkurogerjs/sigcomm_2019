## Tutorial Program (subject to changes)

{% include program-main.html type="tutorial-p4" data=page.data %}


## Call For Participation

This full-day tutorial aims to provide an overview of Named Data Networking (NDN), a newly developed Internet architecture, and IoT application development over NDN. The morning program will introduce the NDN architecture and illustrate its features through a specific use case in IoT. In the afternoon, we will give an overview of the open source NDN-IoT package, demonstrate how to use it and how to contribute to it, followed by a hands-on session on developing simple IoT applications over NDN. We will wrap up the day by a Q&A session, and  invite all the attendance to provide feedbacks.

## Background 
Named Data Networking (NDN) is a new Internet architecture that has been under development since 2010. NDN changes today's TCP/IP architecture's focus on where, i.e., hosts and their IP addresses, to what, i.e., the content that users and applications care about. This fundamental shift can bring profound impact to enhancing Internet security, enabling mobility support, scaling data disseminations as well as data collection (e.g., from IoT devices), and facilitating the development of decentralized applications. NDN research has attracted researchers from both academia and industry around the world to explore all aspects of its design, implementation, and applications. NDN is the most prominent realization of the vision for Information-Centric Networking (ICN), around which a growing research community has formed over the past several years.  

Together with an increasing interest in NDN, there have also been a number of questions as well as misconceptions regarding NDN.  This tutorial aims to bring NDN to the broader networking community by explaining NDN's basic architectural concepts and demonstrating its advantages in supporting IoT applications, introducing the new NDN-IoT package, and offering hands-on exercises to guide participants to develop simple IoT applications. 

We expect the tutorial to benefit network researchers and students with different levels of background knowledge on NDN. For people who want to learn what NDN is, the morning sessions are of particular interest. For people who are looking for ways to contribute to NDN design and development, the afternoon hands-on exercises will be very useful.
