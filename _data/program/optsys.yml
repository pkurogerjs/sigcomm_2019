  title: 'Optical switching in data centers: Opportunities and Challenges (30min)'
  authors: 'Hitesh Ballani (Microsoft research)'
  abstract: ''
  bio: 'I am a researcher in the System and Networking group at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, UK. My research aims to build systems and networks for next-generation data centers. Our current focus is on developing optical technologies for the cloud. Earlier, I graduated from Cornell University where I indulged in follies like Scalable Internet Routing and Network Management.
<br />
I enjoy working on real-world problems, particularly ones that span technical domains. For example, as part of the Predictable Data Centers project (2010-15), we developed technologies for enabling predictable performance across shared cloud resources like networking and storage. Applying traditional networking ideas to the storage stack was key to a lot of our innovation, leading to the SMB Bandwidth Limiting feature in Windows Server 2012 R2, and inspiring the end-to-end Storage QoS feature in Windows Server 2016. This post discusses our journey from whiteboard discussions to a shipping product.
<br />
With our Optics for the Cloud effort (2016-), we are now delving deeper into the data center stack. Our team brings together hardware, optics, networking and application-level expertise to take a cross-stack view towards developing optical technologies that could underpin the next-generation of our cloud infrastructure.'

  title: 'Big data and Optical Lightpaths Driven Data Center Network (30min)'
  authors: T. S. Eugene Ng
  abstract: Physical layer optical communication devices such as optical circuit switches give data center network architects new tools to innovate. The abundant bandwidth capacity of optical devices seems a great match for the insatiable bandwidth demand of big data applications emerging in data centers today. However, big data applications have many important nuanced qualities and they have to be carefully understood and considered by network architects. This talk will discuss some of the recent advances from the BOLD (Big data and Optical Lightpaths Driven) Project at Rice University, which has been investigating big data applications' fundamental characteristics and developing advanced data center network architectures that leverage optical devices to meet the growing challenges presented by big data applications.
