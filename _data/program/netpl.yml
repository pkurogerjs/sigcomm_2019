  title: 'Keynote 2: Building Efficient Packet Processing Flows with NPL'
  authors: 'Venkat Pullela (Broadcom)'
  abstract: 'The design of high-performance switching ASICs is a optimization act on multiple dimensions. Performance, feature and scalability requirements must be balanced with latency, power and silicon area constraints. A language for programming ASIC switching pipelines must focus equally on codifying packet processing flows and enabling efficient use of available hardware resources.Earlier this year, Broadcom open sourced the NPL (Network Programming Language) specification in conjunction with the release of Trident 4, a 12.8Tbps fully programmable network switch ASIC. This talk covers the motivation behind NPL and some of its key constructs. NPL introduces new concepts such as “function primitives” that separate action logic from table lookups; “object strengths” that simplify resolution across various table lookups and explicit support for multiple lookup tables. NPL is accompanied by a compiler suite and programs can be targeted to different architectures. More information about NPL is available at nplang.org.'

  title: 'Keynote 3: Finding Needle in a Haystack - Provenance support for network diagnostics'
  authors: 'Wenchao Zhou (Georgetown University)'
  abstract: 'Provenance provides support for answering “why” questions about computations. It can be extracted naturally from applications written in domain-specific languages, and has found a number of use cases in the database community, such as debugging query answers or tracing unexpected results to database tuples. In fact, the ability to ask “why” can be useful for a much broader range of applications. This talk summarizes our experiences over the past few years in adapting provenance for diagnostic uses in networks and distributed systems. Our work draws inspirations from data provenance, yet the deployment scale, use cases, and the distributed nature of networks require a significant re-design. We review the challenges and lessons we encountered in a number of use cases, ranging from investigating intrusions to diagnosing (and even automatically fixing) networked systems. '

  title: 'Keynote 4: Localizing Router Configuration Errors Using Unsatisfiable Cores'
  authors: 'Aaron Gember Jacobson (Colgate University)'
  abstract: 'Locating errors within router configurations is difficult due to their size and complexity. Although many verification and repair tools have been developed to detect and correct configuration errors, we argue that these tools suffer from a major flaw: insufficient fault localization. Fault localization is the process of identifying which lines of a configuration cause certain policies to be unsatisfied. This information is useful, because it can significantly reduce the space of possible fixes and, correspondingly, the time required to (automatically) repair the configuration. In this talk, we present our technique for accurately localizing errors in network configurations using unsatisfiable cores generated from SMT-based models of network configurations semantics.'
