  bio: 'Siddhartha Sen is a Principal Researcher in the Microsoft Research New York City lab, and previously a researcher in the MSR Silicon Valley lab. He uses data structures, algorithms, and machine learning to build more powerful distributed systems. His current mission is to optimize cloud infrastructure decisions in a way that is minimally disruptive, synergistic with human solutions, and safe. Siddhartha received his BS degrees in computer science and mathematics and his MEng degree in computer science from MIT. From 2004-2007 he worked as a developer at Microsoft and built a network load balancer for Windows Server. He returned to academia and completed his PhD from Princeton University in 2013. Siddhartha received the inaugural Google Fellowship in Fault-Tolerant Computing in 2009, the best student paper award at PODC 2012, and the best paper award at ASPLOS 2017.'
