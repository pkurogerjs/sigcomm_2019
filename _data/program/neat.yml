  title: 'Network Support for Emerging Applications: Flexible Network Services as Frameworks?'
  authors: 'Prof, Zhi-Li Zhang, University of Minnesota, USA'
  abstract: 'Classical IP-based Internet provides only a best-effort service where a network can delay or drop packets with no deterministic performance guarantees. The ascent and dominance of servers virtualization and cloud computing has fundamentally changed the way how we develop large-scale applications and services, giving rise to "application frameworks" that are developed to facilitate and support various classes of application development in cloud environments. In this talk, we will use some examples to motivate and illustrate the new challenges posed by these application frameworks as well as emerging applications such as ML/AI, AR/VR and IoT services. We argue that better network support is needed for co-design of application frameworks, emerging applications and network services.'
  bio: "Zhi-Li Zhang received Ph.D. degrees  in computer science from the University of Massachusetts.  He joined the faculty of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota in 1997, where  he is currently the McKnight Distinguished University Professor and  Qwest Chair Professor in Telecommunications. He currently also serves as the Associate Director for Research at the Digital Technology Center, University of Minnesota. Prof. Zhang's research interests lie broadly in computer and communication networks, Internet technology, multimedia systems and content distribution networks, cyber-physical systems and Internet-of-Things, and (applied) machine learning and data mining. Prof. Zhang has published more than 100 journal and conference/workshop papers, many of them in top venues in networking and related fields. He is co-recipient of several Best Papers awards including IEEE INFOCOM10, ICNP03, ACM SIGMETRICS96 and RAID13 conferences as well as ACM SIGCOMM APNet’18 and NetAI’19 workshops.  Prof. Zhang has chaired several major conferences in networking including IEEE INFOCOM, ACM SIGMETRICS, IEEE ICNP, IFIP Networking and ACM Internet Measurement Conference (IMC), and served on the Editorial Board of several journals such as IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, ACM TOMPECS, and PACM MACS. He is a Fellow of IEEE. "

  title: FlexNGIA – A Fully Flexible Novel Architecture for the Next-Generation Tactile Internet
  authors: 'Prof. Mohamed Faten Zhani, ÉTS Montreal, Canada '
  abstract: 'From virtual reality and teleportation, to telepresence, augmented reality, holograms, and remotely controlled robotics, these future network applications promise an unprecedented development for society, economics and culture by revolutionizing the way we live, learn, work and play. Unfortunately, today’s Internet falls short when it comes to providing the stringent performance requirements imposed by such applications. This is due to several fundamental limitations in the design of the current network architecture and communication protocols. As a result, there is a pressing need to rethink the network architecture and protocols, and efficiently harness recent technological advances in terms of virtualization and network softwarization to design the Tactile Internet of the future.
In this talk, we start by analyzing the characteristics and requirements of future networking applications and highlight the limitations of the current network architecture and protocols. We then draw a rough sketch of FlexNGIA, a Flexible Next-Generation Internet Architecture that is able to satisfy the requirements of future Internet applications and services. We also discuss through some use-cases how FlexNGIA could ensure the service level guarantees required by some of the future network applications.'
