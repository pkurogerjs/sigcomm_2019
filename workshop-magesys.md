### Call for Papers
Advances in distributed artificial intelligence, edge computing, and distributed control are taking the dream of autonomous air-ground vehicles (AGV) beyond the walls of research centers and laboratories. Initial deployments will be likely in Military, Emergency, and Industrial scenarios followed by civilian applications as the technology matures.

Today’s fleets of Autonomous Air-Ground vehicles are still frail and need to overcome many challenges. Examples of those are intermittent and unreliable communication; changes in the network and services available both locally and in the infrastructure; sudden changes in the computing needs and ability to harness CPU/GPU power on demand, either on the edge or in the cloud; cybersecurity threats, etc. MAGESys proposes itself as a forum to discuss transversal cross-domain research efforts on cooperative autonomous air-ground vehicles and their applications.

We welcome papers at the crossroad of AI, Distributed Systems, and Networking covering architectural and system aspects, as well as theoretical foundations, algorithms, protocols and human-machine interface design.
 
### Topics of Interest

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- AGV applications
- Cooperation system design and deployment
- Task scheduling and orchestration
- AGV ad­-hoc networks
- Information Centric Networking for AGV (i.e. NDN)
- Aerial and ground communication protocol design
- Experimental results of aerial­-ground communication
- MAC and routing protocols for AGV fleets
- Theoretical analysis and models for AGV networks
- Spectrum and regulatory issues
- Mobility management
- Mobility­-aware and 3D communication
- Mission and context­-aware solutions
- Positioning and localization
- Delay­-tolerant networks and ferrying
- Autonomous cooperative driving with drones assistance
- Artificial intelligence techniques for AGV
- Vision and object tracking
- Frameworks for distributed AI support
- Cooperative surveillance, smart cameras, and sensors
- Acceptance, security, and privacy aspects
- Air­-ground vehicles testbeds
- Air­-ground edge deployments
- HCI for air­ground computing systems

MAGESys invites and encourages submissions of original work not previously published or under review at another conference or journal. Accepted papers will be published by ACM and considered for the Best Workshop Paper Award.
        
### Submission Instructions
Submissions must be original, unpublished work, and not under consideration at another conference or journal. Submitted papers must use the new ACM template (using sigconf document type) from the [2018 ACM consolidated template package](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)[(you can also use this barebone LaTeX template)](https://github.com/conference-websites/acmart-sigproc-template). The font size must be 9 points. The length of the final paper with all its content except references must not exceed 6 pages. Papers must include author’s names and affiliations for single-blind peer reviewing by the PC. Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their papers at the workshop.

Please submit your paper via [https://magesys19.hotcrp.com](https://magesys19.hotcrp.com).

### Authors Take Note
The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to TWO WEEKS prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

### Registration
Attendance of the workshop is by open registration and subject to the same registration fees and rules as all the other SIGCOMM 2019 workshops. The registrants of the workshop may freely attend any workshop on the same day.

### Camera-ready instructions
For the final paper to be published, please refer to [Camera-ready instructions for workshops]().
